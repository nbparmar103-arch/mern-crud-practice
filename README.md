🧩 MERN CRUD Practice Project

Developed by: Nikhil Parmar

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) CRUD application built as a practice project to understand real-world frontend and backend integration, API handling, validation, and GitHub workflow.

The project demonstrates how a modern web application manages data using a cloud database (MongoDB Atlas) and a RESTful API, with a clean React-based user interface.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Add Records
Create new user records with proper frontend and backend validation.

✅ View Records
Display all stored records in a structured table format.

✅ Edit Records
Update existing user data using modal-based forms.

🔒 Delete (Disabled for Demo Safety)
Delete functionality is implemented at API level but hidden in UI for demo purposes.

✅ Backend Validation
Strong validation at database and API level to ensure data consistency.

☁️ MongoDB Atlas Integration
Uses MongoDB Atlas for secure and scalable cloud data storage.

🔄 Real-world Project Structure
Clean separation of frontend, backend, routes, and models.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was created by Nikhil Parmar to:

Practice full-stack MERN development

Understand API communication between frontend & backend

Work with cloud-based databases

Gain hands-on experience with Git & GitHub workflow

Prepare for client demos, interviews, and real projects

🧪 Demo Notes

Add, View, and Edit operations are fully functional.

Delete is intentionally disabled in the UI for safe demonstrations.

All data is stored securely in MongoDB Atlas.
